PULSE DIFFERENTIATION ANALYSIS:
Performance spread: 0.000000 entanglement units
Leakage spread: 0.000000 leakage units

❌ NO SIGNIFICANT PULSE DIFFERENTIATION
All methods perform essentially identically
System may be in linear regime or pulses too weak

SPATIAL PROPAGATION ANALYSIS:
gaussian_soft: max correlation = 0.0000, avg delay = nan μs
DRAG_aggressive: max correlation = 0.0000, avg delay = nan μs
Theoretical max delay: 1.500 μs
⚠️  Propagation delays below detection threshold
